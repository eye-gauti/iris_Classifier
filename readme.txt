ðŸŒ¸ Iris Flower Classifier

    This is my first machine learning project â€” a simple Iris Flower Classifier built using Logistic Regression from Scikit-learn. It classifies iris flowers into three species based on their petal and sepal measurements.

    The classifier was trained on 75% of the data and tested on the remaining 25%, achieving a strong accuracy score for a first attempt.

    The model achieved an accuracy of 94%.

Project Overview

    Algorithm Used: Logistic Regression
    Library: Scikit-learn
    Dataset: Iris dataset from Kaggle
    Accuracy: \~94%

Output

    The model predicts whether a flower belongs to one of the following classes:
    Setosa
    Versicolor
    Virginica

What I Learned

    Preprocessing and splitting datasets
    Evaluating model performance
    Understanding the workflow of a basic machine learning project

Future Improvements

    Experiment with different models (e.g., KNN, SVM, Decision Tree)
    Tune model hyperparameters for better performance
